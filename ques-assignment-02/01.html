        <h2>Time is a Paradox Itself</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> As a definition says, there was no doubt that time is the indefinite continued progress of existence &
            extinction. Time has been present since everything thing came into existence and it remains till they ended
            up.There are so many philosophies, perceptions, definitions & measurements of the time.
        <p style="font-style: italic;">According
            to
            Carlo Rovelli, the time is an illusion.

            Our naive perception of its flow doesn't correspond to physical
            reality. The concept of time is simply an illusion made-up of human memories.
