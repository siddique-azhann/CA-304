        <p style="font-weight: bold; color: crimson; background: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: block; padding: 02%;"> As a definition says, there was no doubt that time is the indefinite continued progress of existence &
            extinction. Time has been present since everything thing came into existence and it remains till they ended
            up.There are so many philosophies, perceptions, definitions & measurements of the time.
        <p style="font-style: italic; background: rgb(157, 204, 82); color: rgb(161, 91, 6); display: block; padding: 02%;">According
            to
            Carlo Rovelli, the time is an illusion.

            Our naive perception of its flow doesn't correspond to physical
            reality. The concept of time is simply an illusion made-up of human memories.
