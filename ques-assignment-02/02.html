    <h1>Time is a Paradox Itself</h1>
    <p class="para">As a definition says, there was no doubt that time is the indefinite continued progress of existence &
        extinction. Time has been present since everything thing came into existence and it remains till they ended up.
        There are so many philosophies, perceptions, definitions & measurements of the time.
    </p>
    <p class="para">According to Carlo Rovelli, the time is an illusion. Our naive perception of its flow doesn't correspond to
        physical reality. The concept of time is simply an illusion made-up of human memories.</p>
    <h3>Everything happening RIGHT NOW</h3>
    <p class="para">

        ∞_____past________present________future_____∞<br>Past, Present and Future all are happening in its certain
        period like they exists on the dots of a line.</p>

    <p class="para">We're just heading ahead forward in time. We cannot realise any of that thing. Everything should remains going
        on. We used to remember the past and starts living in future. It all flows in a never ending cycle.

        But conflict always arises because we have all that is predictions.

        Although Einstein's theory of special relativity denied that.</p>
    <p class="para">In Quantum Mechanics where regards the flow of time as universal and absolute. Whereas General Relativity regards
        the flow of time as malleable and relative.

        But if we looks from Einstein's perspective we know how right he is. He proposed that time is a relative concept
        and the higher you live above sea level the faster you age. This is practical demonstration of 'Twin Paradox'.

        If we put Quantum Mechanics & theory of General Relativity together we cannot further relates to our determined
        theory.</p>

    <p class="para">But if we put Nietzsche's and Carlo Rovelli's theory together we get that ; Time is also a paradox,


        which means past, present and future all lies with us and happening again & again like a loop.</p>

    <p class="para">WE LIVE, WE DIE, WE LIVE, WE DIE, WE LIVE WE DIE,</p>

    <p class="para">Every moment, every second repeatedly continues in time cycle. Now I favor the side of relative time, not linear.
        Every moment, every second forwards in time which allows them to flow with the time. Like millionths of Deja Vu
        occurred with someone.

        So when the cycle begins, everything repeats itself like it would about to happen or happening or maybe happened
        and past, present & future flow in their regular manner. It's not like Eternal Recurrence's life after life but
        its a never ending cycle of existence and extinction.</p>
